# Mushroom Classification

A machine learning project for classifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous using a Random Forest classifier.

## Project Overview

This project uses the UCI Mushroom Dataset to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical characteristics. The model achieves high accuracy and recall, making it reliable for mushroom classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [UCI Mushroom Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom), which includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family. Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended (the latter class was combined with the poisonous one).

The dataset contains 8,124 mushroom samples with 22 categorical features such as:
- Cap shape, surface, and color
- Bruises presence
- Odor
- Gill attachment, spacing, size, and color
- Stalk shape and root
- And many more

## Model

The classification model uses a pipeline with:
1. **OneHotEncoder** for preprocessing categorical features
2. **RandomForestClassifier** for classification

The model is optimized using GridSearchCV with a focus on maximizing recall (to minimize false negatives, which is critical for mushroom classification).

## Results

The model achieves:
- **Accuracy**: 100%
- **Recall**: 100%

This means the model correctly identifies all poisonous mushrooms in the test set, which is crucial for safety.

## Warning

This model is for educational purposes only. Never rely on a machine learning model to determine if a mushroom is safe to eat. Always consult with a mushroom expert before consuming any wild mushrooms.
